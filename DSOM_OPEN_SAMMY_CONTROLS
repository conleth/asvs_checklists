üõ†Ô∏è SAMM + Tooling for Visualization and Kaizen
üîÑ From Static PDF to Living Dashboard
Dag Flachet explains that historically, organizations would do a one-time SAMM assessment, producing a PDF report that quickly became outdated.

Instead, he recommends:

Using tools like:

OWASP SAMM Toolkit

OpenSAMMY (an OWASP project)

These allow:

Continuous evaluation cycles

Dashboards that track real-time progress

Score expirations, so assessments don‚Äôt go stale

Iterative improvement planning following Kaizen principles

This transforms SAMM from a static compliance tool into a dynamic backbone for continuous AppSec improvement.

üß± How DSOM Fits Into the Picture
DSOM = DevSecOps Maturity Model

Unlike SAMM (which covers Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Operations), DSOM is SDLC-focused, especially on team-level engineering practices.

In large orgs:

Development teams might do DSOM self-assessments

Business units or central AppSec do SAMM assessments

The scores from DSOM map into SAMM‚Äôs "Design, Implement, and Verify" domains.

Other SAMM domains (like Governance and Operations) are handled separately.

This layering allows a bottom-up + top-down view, enabling strategic reporting from developer practices all the way to the boardroom.

üß≠ Bonus Insight: Tool Mapping Dreams
Dag notes that many AppSec leaders struggle with duplicative work‚Äîfilling out:

SAMM

ISO 27001

SOC 2

NIST, etc.

He references an emerging project called OpenCRE / OpenControl mapping, which aims to unify these frameworks and reduce overhead by aligning them behind a common backbone (like SAMM).

‚úÖ Summary
Use SAMM + OpenSAMMY to turn assessments into continuous improvement.

Use DSOM for development team-level insight and map it into SAMM‚Äôs central structure.

Visual dashboards + iterative Kaizen cycles = real-world maturity tracking and improvement.

Tooling should support Kaizen by surfacing what to improve next‚Äînot just what‚Äôs been done.

Let me know if you'd like a visual diagram or mapping chart of how DSOM and SAMM interconnect or how OpenSAMMY works in practice.

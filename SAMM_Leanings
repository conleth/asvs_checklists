🔑 1. Kaizen = “Good Change” via Continuous Improvement
Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning "good change." It promotes small, incremental improvements over time.

In AppSec, this means focusing on manageable improvements rather than trying to solve everything at once (“boiling the ocean”).

🧭 2. Pair Kaizen with OWASP SAMM
The OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) breaks AppSec into discrete activities across five business functions (Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification, Operations).

Combining SAMM with Kaizen enables you to:

Assess current maturity

Create a roadmap of small, prioritized improvements

Track progress over time with clear criteria

🧱 3. Focus on One Drawer at a Time
The metaphor used was: don’t try to clean the whole house, just pick one drawer and do it well.

In AppSec terms, this means: pick one practice (e.g. threat modeling or SAST) and improve it iteratively.

📊 4. Move from Static Reports to Living Dashboards
Traditional maturity assessments (e.g., a PDF report) are quickly outdated.

Instead, use tools like OpenSAMM Toolkit or OpenSAMMY to maintain a live dashboard with expiring scores, continuous updates, and team-level roadmaps.

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 5. Bottom-Up Participation Builds Buy-In
While AppSec leadership often drives maturity improvement, developers and teams should have visibility into the maturity map and contribute to their own roadmap.

Example: a national rail company allowed 200+ teams to self-assess and request AppSec resources bottom-up.

⚖️ 6. SAMM Is for Growth, Not Just Compliance
ISO 27001 and SOC 2 are about compliance, not necessarily improving AppSec processes.

SAMM supports real security improvement over time.

Compliance frameworks can be mapped to SAMM, but the value lies in long-term security posture growth.

🔄 7. Avoid the Points Game Trap
Not all maturity improvements are equal in value. Prioritize what’s impactful, not just what gains points quickly.

Ex: Adding SAST might be easier than implementing threat modeling—but threat modeling may be more valuable in your context.

💡 Final Takeaway
“Don’t be afraid of little steps. If you keep a well-defined map and follow it consistently, small improvements will lead to excellent security outcomes.”

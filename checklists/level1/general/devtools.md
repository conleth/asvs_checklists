# ASVS 1 Checklist – General – Devtools

_Use during DESIGN and PRE-MERGE review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility._

- [ ] V2.1.1 – Verify that the application's documentation defines input validation rules for how to check the validity of data items against an expected structure. This could be common data formats such as credit card numbers, email addresses, telephone numbers, or it could be an internal data format.
- [ ] V2.2.2 – Verify that the application is designed to enforce input validation at a trusted service layer. While client-side validation improves usability and should be encouraged, it must not be relied upon as a security control.
- [ ] V6.1.1 – Verify that application documentation defines how controls such as rate limiting, anti-automation, and adaptive response, are used to defend against attacks such as credential stuffing and password brute force. The documentation must make clear how these controls are configured and prevent malicious account lockout.
- [ ] V6.3.1 – Verify that controls to prevent attacks such as credential stuffing and password brute force are implemented according to the application's security documentation.
- [ ] V8.1.1 – Verify that authorization documentation defines rules for restricting function-level and data-specific access based on consumer permissions and resource attributes.
- [ ] V10.4.1 – Verify that the authorization server validates redirect URIs based on a client-specific allowlist of pre-registered URIs using exact string comparison.
- [ ] V10.4.4 – Verify that for a given client, the authorization server only allows the usage of grants that this client needs to use. Note that the grants 'token' (Implicit flow) and 'password' (Resource Owner Password Credentials flow) must no longer be used.
- [ ] V10.4.5 – Verify that the authorization server mitigates refresh token replay attacks for public clients, preferably using sender-constrained refresh tokens, i.e., Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) or Certificate-Bound Access Tokens using mutual TLS (mTLS). For L1 and L2 applications, refresh token rotation may be used. If refresh token rotation is used, the authorization server must invalidate the refresh token after usage, and revoke all refresh tokens for that authorization if an already used and invalidated refresh token is provided.
- [ ] V12.2.1 – Verify that TLS is used for all connectivity between a client and external facing, HTTP-based services, and does not fall back to insecure or unencrypted communications.
- [ ] V14.3.1 – Verify that authenticated data is cleared from client storage, such as the browser DOM, after the client or session is terminated. The 'Clear-Site-Data' HTTP response header field may be able to help with this but the client-side should also be able to clear up if the server connection is not available when the session is terminated.
- [ ] V15.1.1 – Verify that application documentation defines risk based remediation time frames for 3rd party component versions with vulnerabilities and for updating libraries in general, to minimize the risk from these components.

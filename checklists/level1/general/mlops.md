# ðŸŸ¢ ASVS 1 Checklist â€“ general â€“ mlops

*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*


- [ ] **V1.2.1** â€“ Verify that output encoding for an HTTP response, HTML document, or XML document is relevant for the context required, such as encoding the relevant characters for HTML elements, HTML attributes, HTML comments, CSS, or HTTP header fields, to avoid changing the message or document structure.

- [ ] **V1.2.5** â€“ Verify that the application protects against OS command injection and that operating system calls use parameterized OS queries or use contextual command line output encoding.

- [ ] **V1.3.1** â€“ Verify that all untrusted HTML input from WYSIWYG editors or similar is sanitized using a well-known and secure HTML sanitization library or framework feature.

- [ ] **V1.5.1** â€“ Verify that the application configures XML parsers to use a restrictive configuration and that unsafe features such as resolving external entities are disabled to prevent XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks.

- [ ] **V10.4.5** â€“ Verify that the authorization server mitigates refresh token replay attacks for public clients, preferably using sender-constrained refresh tokens, i.e., Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP) or Certificate-Bound Access Tokens using mutual TLS (mTLS). For L1 and L2 applications, refresh token rotation may be used. If refresh token rotation is used, the authorization server must invalidate the refresh token after usage, and revoke all refresh tokens for that authorization if an already used and invalidated refresh token is provided.

- [ ] **V14.2.1** â€“ Verify that sensitive data is only sent to the server in the HTTP message body or header fields, and that the URL and query string do not contain sensitive information, such as an API key or session token.

- [ ] **V14.3.1** â€“ Verify that authenticated data is cleared from client storage, such as the browser DOM, after the client or session is terminated. The 'Clear-Site-Data' HTTP response header field may be able to help with this but the client-side should also be able to clear up if the server connection is not available when the session is terminated.

- [ ] **V15.2.1** â€“ Verify that the application only contains components which have not breached the documented update and remediation time frames.

- [ ] **V2.1.1** â€“ Verify that the application's documentation defines input validation rules for how to check the validity of data items against an expected structure. This could be common data formats such as credit card numbers, email addresses, telephone numbers, or it could be an internal data format.

- [ ] **V2.2.1** â€“ Verify that input is validated to enforce business or functional expectations for that input. This should either use positive validation against an allow list of values, patterns, and ranges, or be based on comparing the input to an expected structure and logical limits according to predefined rules. For L1, this can focus on input which is used to make specific business or security decisions. For L2 and up, this should apply to all input.

- [ ] **V3.2.1** â€“ Verify that security controls are in place to prevent browsers from rendering content or functionality in HTTP responses in an incorrect context (e.g., when an API, a user-uploaded file or other resource is requested directly). Possible controls could include: not serving the content unless HTTP request header fields (such as Sec-Fetch-\*) indicate it is the correct context, using the sandbox directive of the Content-Security-Policy header field or using the attachment disposition type in the Content-Disposition header field.

- [ ] **V3.4.1** â€“ Verify that a Strict-Transport-Security header field is included on all responses to enforce an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) policy. A maximum age of at least 1 year must be defined, and for L2 and up, the policy must apply to all subdomains as well.

- [ ] **V3.4.2** â€“ Verify that the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Access-Control-Allow-Origin header field is a fixed value by the application, or if the Origin HTTP request header field value is used, it is validated against an allowlist of trusted origins. When 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' needs to be used, verify that the response does not include any sensitive information.

- [ ] **V3.5.1** â€“ Verify that, if the application does not rely on the CORS preflight mechanism to prevent disallowed cross-origin requests to use sensitive functionality, these requests are validated to ensure they originate from the application itself. This may be done by using and validating anti-forgery tokens or requiring extra HTTP header fields that are not CORS-safelisted request-header fields. This is to defend against browser-based request forgery attacks, commonly known as cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

- [ ] **V4.1.1** â€“ Verify that every HTTP response with a message body contains a Content-Type header field that matches the actual content of the response, including the charset parameter to specify safe character encoding (e.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1) according to IANA Media Types, such as "text/", "/+xml" and "/xml".

- [ ] **V5.3.2** â€“ Verify that when the application creates file paths for file operations, instead of user-submitted filenames, it uses internally generated or trusted data, or if user-submitted filenames or file metadata must be used, strict validation and sanitization must be applied. This is to protect against path traversal, local or remote file inclusion (LFI, RFI), and server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

- [ ] **V6.1.1** â€“ Verify that application documentation defines how controls such as rate limiting, anti-automation, and adaptive response, are used to defend against attacks such as credential stuffing and password brute force. The documentation must make clear how these controls are configured and prevent malicious account lockout.

- [ ] **V6.2.4** â€“ Verify that passwords submitted during account registration or password change are checked against an available set of, at least, the top 3000 passwords which match the application's password policy, e.g. minimum length.

- [ ] **V6.4.1** â€“ Verify that system generated initial passwords or activation codes are securely randomly generated, follow the existing password policy, and expire after a short period of time or after they are initially used. These initial secrets must not be permitted to become the long term password.

- [ ] **V7.2.2** â€“ Verify that the application uses either self-contained or reference tokens that are dynamically generated for session management, i.e. not using static API secrets and keys.

- [ ] **V7.4.1** â€“ Verify that when session termination is triggered (such as logout or expiration), the application disallows any further use of the session. For reference tokens or stateful sessions, this means invalidating the session data at the application backend. Applications using self-contained tokens will need a solution such as maintaining a list of terminated tokens, disallowing tokens produced before a per-user date and time or rotating a per-user signing key.

- [ ] **V9.1.1** â€“ Verify that self-contained tokens are validated using their digital signature or MAC to protect against tampering before accepting the token's contents.

- [ ] **V9.1.2** â€“ Verify that only algorithms on an allowlist can be used to create and verify self-contained tokens, for a given context. The allowlist must include the permitted algorithms, ideally only either symmetric or asymmetric algorithms, and must not include the 'None' algorithm. If both symmetric and asymmetric must be supported, additional controls will be needed to prevent key confusion.

- [ ] **V9.1.3** â€“ Verify that key material that is used to validate self-contained tokens is from trusted pre-configured sources for the token issuer, preventing attackers from specifying untrusted sources and keys. For JWTs and other JWS structures, headers such as 'jku', 'x5u', and 'jwk' must be validated against an allowlist of trusted sources.

- [ ] **V9.2.1** â€“ Verify that, if a validity time span is present in the token data, the token and its content are accepted only if the verification time is within this validity time span. For example, for JWTs, the claims 'nbf' and 'exp' must be verified.

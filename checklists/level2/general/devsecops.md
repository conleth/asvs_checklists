# ASVS 2 Checklist – General – Devsecops

_Use during DESIGN and PRE-MERGE review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility._

- [ ] V5.4.3 – Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are scanned by antivirus scanners to prevent serving of known malicious content.
- [ ] V13.3.1 – Verify that a secrets management solution, such as a key vault, is used to securely create, store, control access to, and destroy backend secrets. These could include passwords, key material, integrations with databases and third-party systems, keys and seeds for time-based tokens, other internal secrets, and API keys. Secrets must not be included in application source code or included in build artifacts. For an L3 application, this must involve a hardware-backed solution such as an HSM.

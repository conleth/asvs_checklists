# ASVS 2 Checklist â€“ general â€“ integration

*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*



ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V1**

- [ ] **V1.2.8** â€“ Verify that LaTeX processors are configured securely (such as not using the "--shell-escape" flag) and an allowlist of commands is used to prevent LaTeX injection attacks.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V10**

- [ ] **V10.2.1** â€“ Verify that, if the code flow is used, the OAuth client has protection against browser-based request forgery attacks, commonly known as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which trigger token requests, either by using proof key for code exchange (PKCE) functionality or checking the 'state' parameter that was sent in the authorization request.

- [ ] **V10.2.2** â€“ Verify that, if the OAuth client can interact with more than one authorization server, it has a defense against mix-up attacks. For example, it could require that the authorization server return the 'iss' parameter value and validate it in the authorization response and the token response.

- [ ] **V10.4.11** â€“ Verify that the authorization server configuration only assigns the required scopes to the OAuth client.

- [ ] **V10.5.1** â€“ Verify that the client (as the relying party) mitigates ID Token replay attacks. For example, by ensuring that the 'nonce' claim in the ID Token matches the 'nonce' value sent in the authentication request to the OpenID Provider (in OAuth2 refereed to as the authorization request sent to the authorization server).

- [ ] **V10.5.2** â€“ Verify that the client uniquely identifies the user from ID Token claims, usually the 'sub' claim, which cannot be reassigned to other users (for the scope of an identity provider).

- [ ] **V10.6.1** â€“ Verify that the OpenID Provider only allows values 'code', 'ciba', 'id_token', or 'id_token code' for response mode. Note that 'code' is preferred over 'id_token code' (the OIDC Hybrid flow), and 'token' (any Implicit flow) must not be used.

- [ ] **V10.6.2** â€“ Verify that the OpenID Provider mitigates denial of service through forced logout. By obtaining explicit confirmation from the end-user or, if present, validating parameters in the logout request (initiated by the relying party), such as the 'id_token_hint'.

- [ ] **V10.7.1** â€“ Verify that the authorization server ensures that the user consents to each authorization request. If the identity of the client cannot be assured, the authorization server must always explicitly prompt the user for consent.

- [ ] **V10.7.2** â€“ Verify that when the authorization server prompts for user consent, it presents sufficient and clear information about what is being consented to. When applicable, this should include the nature of the requested authorizations (typically based on scope, resource server, Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) authorization details), the identity of the authorized application, and the lifetime of these authorizations.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V12**

- [ ] **V12.1.3** â€“ Verify that the application validates that mTLS client certificates are trusted before using the certificate identity for authentication or authorization.

- [ ] **V12.3.1** â€“ Verify that an encrypted protocol such as TLS is used for all inbound and outbound connections to and from the application, including monitoring systems, management tools, remote access and SSH, middleware, databases, mainframes, partner systems, or external APIs. The server must not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V13**

- [ ] **V13.1.1** â€“ Verify that all communication needs for the application are documented. This must include external services which the application relies upon and cases where an end user might be able to provide an external location to which the application will then connect.

- [ ] **V13.2.4** â€“ Verify that an allowlist is used to define the external resources or systems with which the application is permitted to communicate (e.g., for outbound requests, data loads, or file access). This allowlist can be implemented at the application layer, web server, firewall, or a combination of different layers.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V15**

- [ ] **V15.3.2** â€“ Verify that where the application backend makes calls to external URLs, it is configured to not follow redirects unless it is intended functionality.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V16**

- [ ] **V16.2.4** â€“ Verify that logs can be read and correlated by the log processor that is in use, preferably by using a common logging format.

- [ ] **V16.5.2** â€“ Verify that the application continues to operate securely when external resource access fails, for example, by using patterns such as circuit breakers or graceful degradation.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V6**

- [ ] **V6.4.4** â€“ Verify that if a multi-factor authentication factor is lost, evidence of identity proofing is performed at the same level as during enrollment.

- [ ] **V6.8.1** â€“ Verify that, if the application supports multiple identity providers (IdPs), the user's identity cannot be spoofed via another supported identity provider (eg. by using the same user identifier). The standard mitigation would be for the application to register and identify the user using a combination of the IdP ID (serving as a namespace) and the user's ID in the IdP.

- [ ] **V6.8.2** â€“ Verify that the presence and integrity of digital signatures on authentication assertions (for example on JWTs or SAML assertions) are always validated, rejecting any assertions that are unsigned or have invalid signatures.

- [ ] **V6.8.3** â€“ Verify that SAML assertions are uniquely processed and used only once within the validity period to prevent replay attacks.

- [ ] **V6.8.4** â€“ Verify that, if an application uses a separate Identity Provider (IdP) and expects specific authentication strength, methods, or recentness for specific functions, the application verifies this using the information returned by the IdP. For example, if OIDC is used, this might be achieved by validating ID Token claims such as 'acr', 'amr', and 'auth_time' (if present). If the IdP does not provide this information, the application must have a documented fallback approach that assumes that the minimum strength authentication mechanism was used (for example, single-factor authentication using username and password).


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V7**

- [ ] **V7.1.3** â€“ Verify that all systems that create and manage user sessions as part of a federated identity management ecosystem (such as SSO systems) are documented along with controls to coordinate session lifetimes, termination, and any other conditions that require re-authentication.

- [ ] **V7.6.1** â€“ Verify that session lifetime and termination between Relying Parties (RPs) and Identity Providers (IdPs) behave as documented, requiring re-authentication as necessary such as when the maximum time between IdP authentication events is reached.

# ASVS 2 Checklist â€“ general â€“ mlops

*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*



ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V1**

- [ ] **V1.2.6** â€“ Verify that the application protects against LDAP injection vulnerabilities, or that specific security controls to prevent LDAP injection have been implemented.

- [ ] **V1.2.7** â€“ Verify that the application is protected against XPath injection attacks by using query parameterization or precompiled queries.

- [ ] **V1.3.11** â€“ Verify that the application sanitizes user input before passing to mail systems to protect against SMTP or IMAP injection.

- [ ] **V1.3.4** â€“ Verify that user-supplied Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) scriptable content is validated or sanitized to contain only tags and attributes (such as draw graphics) that are safe for the application, e.g., do not contain scripts and foreignObject.

- [ ] **V1.3.6** â€“ Verify that the application protects against Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, by validating untrusted data against an allowlist of protocols, domains, paths and ports and sanitizing potentially dangerous characters before using the data to call another service.

- [ ] **V1.3.7** â€“ Verify that the application protects against template injection attacks by not allowing templates to be built based on untrusted input. Where there is no alternative, any untrusted input being included dynamically during template creation must be sanitized or strictly validated.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V10**

- [ ] **V10.2.1** â€“ Verify that, if the code flow is used, the OAuth client has protection against browser-based request forgery attacks, commonly known as cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which trigger token requests, either by using proof key for code exchange (PKCE) functionality or checking the 'state' parameter that was sent in the authorization request.

- [ ] **V10.2.2** â€“ Verify that, if the OAuth client can interact with more than one authorization server, it has a defense against mix-up attacks. For example, it could require that the authorization server return the 'iss' parameter value and validate it in the authorization response and the token response.

- [ ] **V10.3.1** â€“ Verify that the resource server only accepts access tokens that are intended for use with that service (audience). The audience may be included in a structured access token (such as the 'aud' claim in JWT), or it can be checked using the token introspection endpoint.

- [ ] **V10.3.2** â€“ Verify that the resource server enforces authorization decisions based on claims from the access token that define delegated authorization. If claims such as 'sub', 'scope', and 'authorization_details' are present, they must be part of the decision.

- [ ] **V10.3.3** â€“ Verify that if an access control decision requires identifying a unique user from an access token (JWT or related token introspection response), the resource server identifies the user from claims that cannot be reassigned to other users. Typically, it means using a combination of 'iss' and 'sub' claims.

- [ ] **V10.3.4** â€“ Verify that, if the resource server requires specific authentication strength, methods, or recentness, it verifies that the presented access token satisfies these constraints. For example, if present, using the OIDC 'acr', 'amr' and 'auth_time' claims respectively.

- [ ] **V10.4.6** â€“ Verify that, if the code grant is used, the authorization server mitigates authorization code interception attacks by requiring proof key for code exchange (PKCE). For authorization requests, the authorization server must require a valid 'code_challenge' value and must not accept a 'code_challenge_method' value of 'plain'. For a token request, it must require validation of the 'code_verifier' parameter.

- [ ] **V10.5.1** â€“ Verify that the client (as the relying party) mitigates ID Token replay attacks. For example, by ensuring that the 'nonce' claim in the ID Token matches the 'nonce' value sent in the authentication request to the OpenID Provider (in OAuth2 refereed to as the authorization request sent to the authorization server).

- [ ] **V10.5.2** â€“ Verify that the client uniquely identifies the user from ID Token claims, usually the 'sub' claim, which cannot be reassigned to other users (for the scope of an identity provider).

- [ ] **V10.5.4** â€“ Verify that the client validates that the ID Token is intended to be used for that client (audience) by checking that the 'aud' claim from the token is equal to the 'client_id' value for the client.

- [ ] **V10.5.5** â€“ Verify that, when using OIDC back-channel logout, the relying party mitigates denial of service through forced logout and cross-JWT confusion in the logout flow. The client must verify that the logout token is correctly typed with a value of 'logout+jwt', contains the 'event' claim with the correct member name, and does not contain a 'nonce' claim. Note that it is also recommended to have a short expiration (e.g., 2 minutes).

- [ ] **V10.6.2** â€“ Verify that the OpenID Provider mitigates denial of service through forced logout. By obtaining explicit confirmation from the end-user or, if present, validating parameters in the logout request (initiated by the relying party), such as the 'id_token_hint'.

- [ ] **V10.7.2** â€“ Verify that when the authorization server prompts for user consent, it presents sufficient and clear information about what is being consented to. When applicable, this should include the nature of the requested authorizations (typically based on scope, resource server, Rich Authorization Requests (RAR) authorization details), the identity of the authorized application, and the lifetime of these authorizations.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V11**

- [ ] **V11.1.2** â€“ Verify that a cryptographic inventory is performed, maintained, regularly updated, and includes all cryptographic keys, algorithms, and certificates used by the application. It must also document where keys can and cannot be used in the system, and the types of data that can and cannot be protected using the keys.

- [ ] **V11.2.2** â€“ Verify that the application is designed with crypto agility such that random number, authenticated encryption, MAC, or hashing algorithms, key lengths, rounds, ciphers and modes can be reconfigured, upgraded, or swapped at any time, to protect against cryptographic breaks. Similarly, it must also be possible to replace keys and passwords and re-encrypt data. This will allow for seamless upgrades to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), once high-assurance implementations of approved PQC schemes or standards are widely available.

- [ ] **V11.3.3** â€“ Verify that encrypted data is protected against unauthorized modification preferably by using an approved authenticated encryption method or by combining an approved encryption method with an approved MAC algorithm.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V12**

- [ ] **V12.3.1** â€“ Verify that an encrypted protocol such as TLS is used for all inbound and outbound connections to and from the application, including monitoring systems, management tools, remote access and SSH, middleware, databases, mainframes, partner systems, or external APIs. The server must not fall back to insecure or unencrypted protocols.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V14**

- [ ] **V14.1.1** â€“ Verify that all sensitive data created and processed by the application has been identified and classified into protection levels. This includes data that is only encoded and therefore easily decoded, such as Base64 strings or the plaintext payload inside a JWT. Protection levels need to take into account any data protection and privacy regulations and standards which the application is required to comply with.

- [ ] **V14.3.3** â€“ Verify that data stored in browser storage (such as localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, or cookies) does not contain sensitive data, with the exception of session tokens.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V15**

- [ ] **V15.1.2** â€“ Verify that an inventory catalog, such as software bill of materials (SBOM), is maintained of all third-party libraries in use, including verifying that components come from pre-defined, trusted, and continually maintained repositories.

- [ ] **V15.1.3** â€“ Verify that the application documentation identifies functionality which is time-consuming or resource-demanding. This must include how to prevent a loss of availability due to overusing this functionality and how to avoid a situation where building a response takes longer than the consumer's timeout. Potential defenses may include asynchronous processing, using queues, and limiting parallel processes per user and per application.

- [ ] **V15.2.2** â€“ Verify that the application has implemented defenses against loss of availability due to functionality which is time-consuming or resource-demanding, based on the documented security decisions and strategies for this.

- [ ] **V15.3.3** â€“ Verify that the application has countermeasures to protect against mass assignment attacks by limiting allowed fields per controller and action, e.g., it is not possible to insert or update a field value when it was not intended to be part of that action.

- [ ] **V15.3.7** â€“ Verify that the application has defenses against HTTP parameter pollution attacks, particularly if the application framework makes no distinction about the source of request parameters (query string, body parameters, cookies, or header fields).


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V16**

- [ ] **V16.2.1** â€“ Verify that each log entry includes necessary metadata (such as when, where, who, what) that would allow for a detailed investigation of the timeline when an event happens.

- [ ] **V16.2.5** â€“ Verify that when logging sensitive data, the application enforces logging based on the data's protection level. For example, it may not be allowed to log certain data, such as credentials or payment details. Other data, such as session tokens, may only be logged by being hashed or masked, either in full or partially.

- [ ] **V16.3.2** â€“ Verify that failed authorization attempts are logged. For L3, this must include logging all authorization decisions, including logging when sensitive data is accessed (without logging the sensitive data itself).

- [ ] **V16.3.4** â€“ Verify that the application logs unexpected errors and security control failures such as backend TLS failures.

- [ ] **V16.4.3** â€“ Verify that logs are securely transmitted to a logically separate system for analysis, detection, alerting, and escalation. The aim is to ensure that if the application is breached, the logs are not compromised.

- [ ] **V16.5.2** â€“ Verify that the application continues to operate securely when external resource access fails, for example, by using patterns such as circuit breakers or graceful degradation.

- [ ] **V16.5.3** â€“ Verify that the application fails gracefully and securely, including when an exception occurs, preventing fail-open conditions such as processing a transaction despite errors resulting from validation logic.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V2**

- [ ] **V2.4.1** â€“ Verify that anti-automation controls are in place to protect against excessive calls to application functions that could lead to data exfiltration, garbage-data creation, quota exhaustion, rate-limit breaches, denial-of-service, or overuse of costly resources.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V3**

- [ ] **V3.4.4** â€“ Verify that all HTTP responses contain an 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' header field. This instructs browsers not to use content sniffing and MIME type guessing for the given response, and to require the response's Content-Type header field value to match the destination resource. For example, the response to a request for a style is only accepted if the response's Content-Type is 'text/css'. This also enables the use of the Cross-Origin Read Blocking (CORB) functionality by the browser.

- [ ] **V3.4.5** â€“ Verify that the application sets a referrer policy to prevent leakage of technically sensitive data to third-party services via the 'Referer' HTTP request header field. This can be done using the Referrer-Policy HTTP response header field or via HTML element attributes. Sensitive data could include path and query data in the URL, and for internal non-public applications also the hostname.

- [ ] **V3.7.2** â€“ Verify that the application will only automatically redirect the user to a different hostname or domain (which is not controlled by the application) where the destination appears on an allowlist.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V4**

- [ ] **V4.4.2** â€“ Verify that, during the initial HTTP WebSocket handshake, the Origin header field is checked against a list of origins allowed for the application.

- [ ] **V4.4.4** â€“ Verify that dedicated WebSocket session management tokens are initially obtained or validated through the previously authenticated HTTPS session when transitioning an existing HTTPS session to a WebSocket channel.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V5**

- [ ] **V5.2.3** â€“ Verify that the application checks compressed files (e.g., zip, gz, docx, odt) against maximum allowed uncompressed size and against maximum number of files before uncompressing the file.

- [ ] **V5.4.2** â€“ Verify that file names served (e.g., in HTTP response header fields or email attachments) are encoded or sanitized (e.g., following RFC 6266) to preserve document structure and prevent injection attacks.

- [ ] **V5.4.3** â€“ Verify that files obtained from untrusted sources are scanned by antivirus scanners to prevent serving of known malicious content.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V6**

- [ ] **V6.2.12** â€“ Verify that passwords submitted during account registration or password changes are checked against a set of breached passwords.

- [ ] **V6.3.3** â€“ Verify that either a multi-factor authentication mechanism or a combination of single-factor authentication mechanisms, must be used in order to access the application. For L3, one of the factors must be a hardware-based authentication mechanism which provides compromise and impersonation resistance against phishing attacks while verifying the intent to authenticate by requiring a user-initiated action (such as a button press on a FIDO hardware key or a mobile phone). Relaxing any of the considerations in this requirement requires a fully documented rationale and a comprehensive set of mitigating controls.

- [ ] **V6.6.1** â€“ Verify that authentication mechanisms using the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) to deliver One-time Passwords (OTPs) via phone or SMS are offered only when the phone number has previously been validated, alternate stronger methods (such as Time based One-time Passwords) are also offered, and the service provides information on their security risks to users. For L3 applications, phone and SMS must not be available as options.

- [ ] **V6.6.3** â€“ Verify that a code based out-of-band authentication mechanism is protected against brute force attacks by using rate limiting. Consider also using a code with at least 64 bits of entropy.

- [ ] **V6.8.1** â€“ Verify that, if the application supports multiple identity providers (IdPs), the user's identity cannot be spoofed via another supported identity provider (eg. by using the same user identifier). The standard mitigation would be for the application to register and identify the user using a combination of the IdP ID (serving as a namespace) and the user's ID in the IdP.

- [ ] **V6.8.2** â€“ Verify that the presence and integrity of digital signatures on authentication assertions (for example on JWTs or SAML assertions) are always validated, rejecting any assertions that are unsigned or have invalid signatures.

- [ ] **V6.8.3** â€“ Verify that SAML assertions are uniquely processed and used only once within the validity period to prevent replay attacks.

- [ ] **V6.8.4** â€“ Verify that, if an application uses a separate Identity Provider (IdP) and expects specific authentication strength, methods, or recentness for specific functions, the application verifies this using the information returned by the IdP. For example, if OIDC is used, this might be achieved by validating ID Token claims such as 'acr', 'amr', and 'auth_time' (if present). If the IdP does not provide this information, the application must have a documented fallback approach that assumes that the minimum strength authentication mechanism was used (for example, single-factor authentication using username and password).


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V7**

- [ ] **V7.5.1** â€“ Verify that the application requires full re-authentication before allowing modifications to sensitive account attributes which may affect authentication such as email address, phone number, MFA configuration, or other information used in account recovery.

- [ ] **V7.5.2** â€“ Verify that users are able to view and (having authenticated again with at least one factor) terminate any or all currently active sessions.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V9**

- [ ] **V9.2.3** â€“ Verify that the service only accepts tokens which are intended for use with that service (audience). For JWTs, this can be achieved by validating the 'aud' claim against an allowlist defined in the service.

- [ ] **V9.2.4** â€“ Verify that, if a token issuer uses the same private key for issuing tokens to different audiences, the issued tokens contain an audience restriction that uniquely identifies the intended audiences. This will prevent a token from being reused with an unintended audience. If the audience identifier is dynamically provisioned, the token issuer must validate these audiences in order to make sure that they do not result in audience impersonation.

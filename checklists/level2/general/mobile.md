# ASVS 2 Checklist ðŸŸ¡ â€“ General â€“ Mobile

_Use during DESIGN and PRE-MERGE review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility._

- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ V1.3.7 â€“ Verify that the application protects against template injection attacks by not allowing templates to be built based on untrusted input. Where there is no alternative, any untrusted input being included dynamically during template creation must be sanitized or strictly validated.

- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ V6.3.3 â€“ Verify that either a multi-factor authentication mechanism or a combination of single-factor authentication mechanisms, must be used in order to access the application. For L3, one of the factors must be a hardware-based authentication mechanism which provides compromise and impersonation resistance against phishing attacks while verifying the intent to authenticate by requiring a user-initiated action (such as a button press on a FIDO hardware key or a mobile phone). Relaxing any of the considerations in this requirement requires a fully documented rationale and a comprehensive set of mitigating controls.

# ASVS 2 Checklist – General – Security

_Use during DESIGN and PRE-MERGE review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility._

- [ ] V6.5.1 – Verify that lookup secrets, out-of-band authentication requests or codes, and time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) are only successfully usable once.
- [ ] V6.5.2 – Verify that, when being stored in the application's backend, lookup secrets with less than 112 bits of entropy (19 random alphanumeric characters or 34 random digits) are hashed with an approved password storage hashing algorithm that incorporates a 32-bit random salt. A standard hash function can be used if the secret has 112 bits of entropy or more.
- [ ] V6.5.3 – Verify that lookup secrets, out-of-band authentication code, and time-based one-time password seeds, are generated using a Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (CSPRNG) to avoid predictable values.
- [ ] V6.5.4 – Verify that lookup secrets and out-of-band authentication codes have a minimum of 20 bits of entropy (typically 4 random alphanumeric characters or 6 random digits is sufficient).
- [ ] V6.8.2 – Verify that the presence and integrity of digital signatures on authentication assertions (for example on JWTs or SAML assertions) are always validated, rejecting any assertions that are unsigned or have invalid signatures.
- [ ] V9.2.3 – Verify that the service only accepts tokens which are intended for use with that service (audience). For JWTs, this can be achieved by validating the 'aud' claim against an allowlist defined in the service.
- [ ] V10.1.2 – Verify that the client only accepts values from the authorization server (such as the authorization code or ID Token) if these values result from an authorization flow that was initiated by the same user agent session and transaction. This requires that client-generated secrets, such as the proof key for code exchange (PKCE) 'code_verifier', 'state' or OIDC 'nonce', are not guessable, are specific to the transaction, and are securely bound to both the client and the user agent session in which the transaction was started.
- [ ] V10.3.1 – Verify that the resource server only accepts access tokens that are intended for use with that service (audience). The audience may be included in a structured access token (such as the 'aud' claim in JWT), or it can be checked using the token introspection endpoint.
- [ ] V10.3.3 – Verify that if an access control decision requires identifying a unique user from an access token (JWT or related token introspection response), the resource server identifies the user from claims that cannot be reassigned to other users. Typically, it means using a combination of 'iss' and 'sub' claims.
- [ ] V10.5.5 – Verify that, when using OIDC back-channel logout, the relying party mitigates denial of service through forced logout and cross-JWT confusion in the logout flow. The client must verify that the logout token is correctly typed with a value of 'logout+jwt', contains the 'event' claim with the correct member name, and does not contain a 'nonce' claim. Note that it is also recommended to have a short expiration (e.g., 2 minutes).
- [ ] V11.1.1 – Verify that there is a documented policy for management of cryptographic keys and a cryptographic key lifecycle that follows a key management standard such as NIST SP 800-57. This should include ensuring that keys are not overshared (for example, with more than two entities for shared secrets and more than one entity for private keys).
- [ ] V11.1.2 – Verify that a cryptographic inventory is performed, maintained, regularly updated, and includes all cryptographic keys, algorithms, and certificates used by the application. It must also document where keys can and cannot be used in the system, and the types of data that can and cannot be protected using the keys.
- [ ] V11.2.1 – Verify that industry-validated implementations (including libraries and hardware-accelerated implementations) are used for cryptographic operations.
- [ ] V11.2.2 – Verify that the application is designed with crypto agility such that random number, authenticated encryption, MAC, or hashing algorithms, key lengths, rounds, ciphers and modes can be reconfigured, upgraded, or swapped at any time, to protect against cryptographic breaks. Similarly, it must also be possible to replace keys and passwords and re-encrypt data. This will allow for seamless upgrades to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), once high-assurance implementations of approved PQC schemes or standards are widely available.
- [ ] V11.2.3 – Verify that all cryptographic primitives utilize a minimum of 128-bits of security based on the algorithm, key size, and configuration. For example, a 256-bit ECC key provides roughly 128 bits of security where RSA requires a 3072-bit key to achieve 128 bits of security.
- [ ] V11.3.3 – Verify that encrypted data is protected against unauthorized modification preferably by using an approved authenticated encryption method or by combining an approved encryption method with an approved MAC algorithm.
- [ ] V11.4.2 – Verify that passwords are stored using an approved, computationally intensive, key derivation function (also known as a "password hashing function"), with parameter settings configured based on current guidance. The settings should balance security and performance to make brute-force attacks sufficiently challenging for the required level of security.
- [ ] V11.4.3 – Verify that hash functions used in digital signatures, as part of data authentication or data integrity are collision resistant and have appropriate bit-lengths. If collision resistance is required, the output length must be at least 256 bits. If only resistance to second pre-image attacks is required, the output length must be at least 128 bits.
- [ ] V11.4.4 – Verify that the application uses approved key derivation functions with key stretching parameters when deriving secret keys from passwords. The parameters in use must balance security and performance to prevent brute-force attacks from compromising the resulting cryptographic key.
- [ ] V11.5.1 – Verify that all random numbers and strings which are intended to be non-guessable must be generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) and have at least 128 bits of entropy. Note that UUIDs do not respect this condition.
- [ ] V11.6.1 – Verify that only approved cryptographic algorithms and modes of operation are used for key generation and seeding, and digital signature generation and verification. Key generation algorithms must not generate insecure keys vulnerable to known attacks, for example, RSA keys which are vulnerable to Fermat factorization.
- [ ] V12.3.3 – Verify that TLS or another appropriate transport encryption mechanism used for all connectivity between internal, HTTP-based services within the application, and does not fall back to insecure or unencrypted communications.
- [ ] V13.3.1 – Verify that a secrets management solution, such as a key vault, is used to securely create, store, control access to, and destroy backend secrets. These could include passwords, key material, integrations with databases and third-party systems, keys and seeds for time-based tokens, other internal secrets, and API keys. Secrets must not be included in application source code or included in build artifacts. For an L3 application, this must involve a hardware-backed solution such as an HSM.
- [ ] V14.1.1 – Verify that all sensitive data created and processed by the application has been identified and classified into protection levels. This includes data that is only encoded and therefore easily decoded, such as Base64 strings or the plaintext payload inside a JWT. Protection levels need to take into account any data protection and privacy regulations and standards which the application is required to comply with.
- [ ] V14.1.2 – Verify that all sensitive data protection levels have a documented set of protection requirements. This must include (but not be limited to) requirements related to general encryption, integrity verification, retention, how the data is to be logged, access controls around sensitive data in logs, database-level encryption, privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies to be used, and other confidentiality requirements.
- [ ] V14.2.4 – Verify that controls around sensitive data related to encryption, integrity verification, retention, how the data is to be logged, access controls around sensitive data in logs, privacy and privacy-enhancing technologies, are implemented as defined in the documentation for the specific data's protection level.
- [ ] V16.2.5 – Verify that when logging sensitive data, the application enforces logging based on the data's protection level. For example, it may not be allowed to log certain data, such as credentials or payment details. Other data, such as session tokens, may only be logged by being hashed or masked, either in full or partially.
- [ ] V17.2.1 – Verify that the key for the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) certificate is managed and protected based on the documented policy for management of cryptographic keys.

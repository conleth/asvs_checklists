# ðŸŸ¡ ASVS 2 Checklist â€“ java â€“ frontend

*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*


- [ ] **V10.1.1** â€“ Verify that tokens are only sent to components that strictly need them. For example, when using a backend-for-frontend pattern for browser-based JavaScript applications, access and refresh tokens shall only be accessible for the backend.

- [ ] **V15.3.6** â€“ Verify that JavaScript code is written in a way that prevents prototype pollution, for example, by using Set() or Map() instead of object literals.

- [ ] **V3.4.3** â€“ Verify that HTTP responses include a Content-Security-Policy response header field which defines directives to ensure the browser only loads and executes trusted content or resources, in order to limit execution of malicious JavaScript. As a minimum, a global policy must be used which includes the directives object-src 'none' and base-uri 'none' and defines either an allowlist or uses nonces or hashes. For an L3 application, a per-response policy with nonces or hashes must be defined.

- [ ] **V3.7.1** â€“ Verify that the application only uses client-side technologies which are still supported and considered secure. Examples of technologies which do not meet this requirement include NSAPI plugins, Flash, Shockwave, ActiveX, Silverlight, NACL, or client-side Java applets.

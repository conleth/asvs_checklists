- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ V3.4.3 â€“ Verify that HTTP responses include a Content-Security-Policy response header field which defines directives to ensure the browser only loads and executes trusted content or resources, in order to limit execution of malicious JavaScript. As a minimum, a global policy must be used which includes the directives object-src 'none' and base-uri 'none' and defines either an allowlist or uses nonces or hashes. For an L3 application, a per-response policy with nonces or hashes must be defined.

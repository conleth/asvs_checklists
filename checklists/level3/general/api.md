# ASVS 3 Checklist â€“ general â€“ api

*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*



ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V1**

- [ ] **V1.2.10** â€“ Verify that the application is protected against CSV and Formula Injection. The application must follow the escaping rules defined in RFC 4180 sections 2.6 and 2.7 when exporting CSV content. Additionally, when exporting to CSV or other spreadsheet formats (such as XLS, XLSX, or ODF), special characters (including '=', '+', '-', '@', '\t' (tab), and '\0' (null character)) must be escaped with a single quote if they appear as the first character in a field value.

- [ ] **V1.5.3** â€“ Verify that different parsers used in the application for the same data type (e.g., JSON parsers, XML parsers, URL parsers), perform parsing in a consistent way and use the same character encoding mechanism to avoid issues such as JSON Interoperability vulnerabilities or different URI or file parsing behavior being exploited in Remote File Inclusion (RFI) or Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V12**

- [ ] **V12.3.5** â€“ Verify that services communicating internally within a system (intra-service communications) use strong authentication to ensure that each endpoint is verified. Strong authentication methods, such as TLS client authentication, must be employed to ensure identity, using public-key infrastructure and mechanisms that are resistant to replay attacks. For microservice architectures, consider using a service mesh to simplify certificate management and enhance security.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V2**

- [ ] **V2.4.2** â€“ Verify that business logic flows require realistic human timing, preventing excessively rapid transaction submissions.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V3**

- [ ] **V3.5.6** â€“ Verify that JSONP functionality is not enabled anywhere across the application to avoid Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) attacks.

- [ ] **V3.5.8** â€“ Verify that authenticated resources (such as images, videos, scripts, and other documents) can be loaded or embedded on behalf of the user only when intended. This can be accomplished by strict validation of the Sec-Fetch-* HTTP request header fields to ensure that the request did not originate from an inappropriate cross-origin call, or by setting a restrictive Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy HTTP response header field to instruct the browser to block returned content.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V4**

- [ ] **V4.1.4** â€“ Verify that only HTTP methods that are explicitly supported by the application or its API (including OPTIONS during preflight requests) can be used and that unused methods are blocked.

- [ ] **V4.2.5** â€“ Verify that, if the application (backend or frontend) builds and sends requests, it uses validation, sanitization, or other mechanisms to avoid creating URIs (such as for API calls) or HTTP request header fields (such as Authorization or Cookie), which are too long to be accepted by the receiving component. This could cause a denial of service, such as when sending an overly long request (e.g., a long cookie header field), which results in the server always responding with an error status.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V6**

- [ ] **V6.6.4** â€“ Verify that, where push notifications are used for multi-factor authentication, rate limiting is used to prevent push bombing attacks. Number matching may also mitigate this risk.


ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V8**

- [ ] **V8.4.2** â€“ Verify that access to administrative interfaces incorporates multiple layers of security, including continuous consumer identity verification, device security posture assessment, and contextual risk analysis, ensuring that network location or trusted endpoints are not the sole factors for authorization even though they may reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.

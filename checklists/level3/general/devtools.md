# ðŸ”´ ASVS 3 Checklist â€“ general â€“ devtools

*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*


- [ ] **V10.2.3** â€“ Verify that the OAuth client only requests the required scopes (or other authorization parameters) in requests to the authorization server.

- [ ] **V10.4.12** â€“ Verify that for a given client, the authorization server only allows the 'response_mode' value that this client needs to use. For example, by having the authorization server validate this value against the expected values or by using pushed authorization request (PAR) or JWT-secured Authorization Request (JAR).

- [ ] **V10.4.15** â€“ Verify that, for a server-side client (which is not executed on the end-user device), the authorization server ensures that the 'authorization_details' parameter value is from the client backend and that the user has not tampered with it. For example, by requiring the usage of pushed authorization request (PAR) or JWT-secured Authorization Request (JAR).

- [ ] **V10.4.16** â€“ Verify that the client is confidential and the authorization server requires the use of strong client authentication methods (based on public-key cryptography and resistant to replay attacks), such as mutual TLS ('tls_client_auth', 'self_signed_tls_client_auth') or private key JWT ('private_key_jwt').

- [ ] **V12.1.5** â€“ Verify that Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is enabled in the application's TLS settings to prevent exposure of sensitive metadata, such as the Server Name Indication (SNI), during TLS handshake processes.

- [ ] **V12.3.5** â€“ Verify that services communicating internally within a system (intra-service communications) use strong authentication to ensure that each endpoint is verified. Strong authentication methods, such as TLS client authentication, must be employed to ensure identity, using public-key infrastructure and mechanisms that are resistant to replay attacks. For microservice architectures, consider using a service mesh to simplify certificate management and enhance security.

- [ ] **V13.1.2** â€“ Verify that for each service the application uses, the documentation defines the maximum number of concurrent connections (e.g., connection pool limits) and how the application behaves when that limit is reached, including any fallback or recovery mechanisms, to prevent denial of service conditions.

- [ ] **V13.1.3** â€“ Verify that the application documentation defines resourceâ€‘management strategies for every external system or service it uses (e.g., databases, file handles, threads, HTTP connections). This should include resourceâ€‘release procedures, timeout settings, failure handling, and where retry logic is implemented, specifying retry limits, delays, and backâ€‘off algorithms. For synchronous HTTP requestâ€“response operations it should mandate short timeouts and either disable retries or strictly limit retries to prevent cascading delays and resource exhaustion.

- [ ] **V13.1.4** â€“ Verify that the application's documentation defines the secrets that are critical for the security of the application and a schedule for rotating them, based on the organization's threat model and business requirements.

- [ ] **V13.3.4** â€“ Verify that secrets are configured to expire and be rotated based on the application's documentation.

- [ ] **V15.1.4** â€“ Verify that application documentation highlights third-party libraries which are considered to be "risky components".

- [ ] **V15.1.5** â€“ Verify that application documentation highlights parts of the application where "dangerous functionality" is being used.

- [ ] **V17.2.6** â€“ Verify that the media server is not susceptible to the "ClientHello" Race Condition vulnerability in Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) by checking if the media server is publicly known to be vulnerable or by performing the race condition test.

- [ ] **V3.1.1** â€“ Verify that application documentation states the expected security features that browsers using the application must support (such as HTTPS, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), Content Security Policy (CSP), and other relevant HTTP security mechanisms). It must also define how the application must behave when some of these features are not available (such as warning the user or blocking access).

- [ ] **V6.3.5** â€“ Verify that users are notified of suspicious authentication attempts (successful or unsuccessful). This may include authentication attempts from an unusual location or client, partially successful authentication (only one of multiple factors), an authentication attempt after a long period of inactivity or a successful authentication after several unsuccessful attempts.

- [ ] **V6.5.8** â€“ Verify that time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) are checked based on a time source from a trusted service and not from an untrusted or client provided time.

- [ ] **V8.1.3** â€“ Verify that the application's documentation defines the environmental and contextual attributes (including but not limited to, time of day, user location, IP address, or device) that are used in the application to make security decisions, including those pertaining to authentication and authorization.

- [ ] **V8.1.4** â€“ Verify that authentication and authorization documentation defines how environmental and contextual factors are used in decision-making, in addition to function-level, data-specific, and field-level authorization. This should include the attributes evaluated, thresholds for risk, and actions taken (e.g., allow, challenge, deny, step-up authentication).

- [ ] **V8.2.4** â€“ Verify that adaptive security controls based on a consumer's environmental and contextual attributes (such as time of day, location, IP address, or device) are implemented for authentication and authorization decisions, as defined in the application's documentation. These controls must be applied when the consumer tries to start a new session and also during an existing session.

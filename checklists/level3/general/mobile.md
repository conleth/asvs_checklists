# ASVS 3 Checklist – General – Mobile

_Use during DESIGN and PRE-MERGE review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility._

- [ ] V6.5.6 – Verify that any authentication factor (including physical devices) can be revoked in case of theft or other loss.
- [ ] V6.7.2 – Verify that the challenge nonce is at least 64 bits in length, and statistically unique or unique over the lifetime of the cryptographic device.
- [ ] V8.1.3 – Verify that the application's documentation defines the environmental and contextual attributes (including but not limited to, time of day, user location, IP address, or device) that are used in the application to make security decisions, including those pertaining to authentication and authorization.
- [ ] V8.2.4 – Verify that adaptive security controls based on a consumer's environmental and contextual attributes (such as time of day, location, IP address, or device) are implemented for authentication and authorization decisions, as defined in the application's documentation. These controls must be applied when the consumer tries to start a new session and also during an existing session.
- [ ] V8.3.2 – Verify that changes to values on which authorization decisions are made are applied immediately. Where changes cannot be applied immediately, (such as when relying on data in self-contained tokens), there must be mitigating controls to alert when a consumer performs an action when they are no longer authorized to do so and revert the change. Note that this alternative would not mitigate information leakage.
- [ ] V8.4.2 – Verify that access to administrative interfaces incorporates multiple layers of security, including continuous consumer identity verification, device security posture assessment, and contextual risk analysis, ensuring that network location or trusted endpoints are not the sole factors for authorization even though they may reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.
- [ ] V10.4.15 – Verify that, for a server-side client (which is not executed on the end-user device), the authorization server ensures that the 'authorization_details' parameter value is from the client backend and that the user has not tampered with it. For example, by requiring the usage of pushed authorization request (PAR) or JWT-secured Authorization Request (JAR).

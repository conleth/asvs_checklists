*Use during **DESIGN** and **PREâ€‘MERGE** review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility.*



ðŸŽ¯ **ASVS V8**

- [ ] **V8.3.2** â€“ Verify that changes to values on which authorization decisions are made are applied immediately. Where changes cannot be applied immediately, (such as when relying on data in self-contained tokens), there must be mitigating controls to alert when a consumer performs an action when they are no longer authorized to do so and revert the change. Note that this alternative would not mitigate information leakage.

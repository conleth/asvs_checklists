# ASVS 3 Checklist – General – Observability

_Use during DESIGN and PRE-MERGE review. This list is tailored to your stack and responsibility._

- [ ] V8.3.2 – Verify that changes to values on which authorization decisions are made are applied immediately. Where changes cannot be applied immediately, (such as when relying on data in self-contained tokens), there must be mitigating controls to alert when a consumer performs an action when they are no longer authorized to do so and revert the change. Note that this alternative would not mitigate information leakage.
